Every commit will have 1 or 2 exercise/assignments done by me while following videos and using instructions.

##How to use files
1. Click on Commits.
2. Click on which exercise/assignment code you want.
3. Check if the next commit has any bug fixes or not.
4. On top right of the code, click the Raw button.
5. Copy and paste that code in a separate file and name it accordingly.
6. Check if all links to the stylesheet or JavaScript matches (in rare cases they might be different).
